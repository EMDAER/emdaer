## What is emdaer?

emdaer was created because READMEs (and other documentation files) are crucial files that are often lackluster and have a tendency to become stale

At its core, emdaer enables you to use plugins and transforms within markdown files

Here are a few use cases that illustrate the power of emdaer:
- Do you have a series of repositories that should have their READMEs kept in sync? With emdaer you can create a template that pulls all the information from each project's package.json and codebase
- Do you want to thank your contributors in your README? With emdaer you can pull that information from GitHub automatically and have it organized in an attractive list or table (work in progress)
- Do you want to keep up to date code samples in your README? With emdaer it from your inline documentation or tests (work in progress)
